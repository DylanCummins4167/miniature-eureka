##Note Taker
The Note Taker is a web application that allows users to create and manage notes. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to enter note titles and corresponding text. The application also allows users to save and delete notes, as well as view and edit existing notes.

#Features
Landing Page: Upon opening the Note Taker, users are presented with a landing page that provides an overview of the application and a call-to-action button to get started.

Notes Page: Clicking on the "Get Started" button on the landing page navigates users to the notes page. The notes page consists of two columns. The left-hand column displays a list of existing notes, while the right-hand column provides fields to enter a new note's title and text.

Saving a Note: When users enter a new note's title and text, a Save icon appears in the navigation bar at the top of the page. Clicking on the Save icon saves the new note and adds it to the list of existing notes in the left-hand column.

Viewing and Editing a Note: Clicking on an existing note in the list on the left-hand column displays the note's details (title and text) in the right-hand column. Users can edit the note's content by modifying the text in the corresponding fields.

Deleting a Note: Each note in the list on the left-hand column is accompanied by a delete button. Clicking on the delete button removes the note from the list.
